# C Programming Exercises

This repository contains solutions to selected exercises from the book: "The C programming language, 2nd edition". The naming convention for the c files is: ```[chapter]-[exercise].c```.

## Downloading and running the programs

An example of how to download and run the files is provided below.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/anpenta/c-programming-exercises.git
cd c-programming-exercises/code
make all
```

This will compile all the files into separate executables using the ```Makefile```. You can then run the executables with the command: ```./[chapter]-[exercise]```. You can remove all the executables with the command: ```make clean```.
